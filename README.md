# About

This repository replaces the original repository of DownOnSpot, which is now private under a different repository name to explain why.

# What happened

I have received a [letter to cease and desist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist) DownOnSpot.

The letter mentioned that DownOnSpot violates their trademark with the logo and is also legally questionable due to being a downloader for Spotify songs.

I have complied with Spotify's request and have privated the repository.

That being said, you may find up-to-date forks (e.g., by searching the latest commit `f0a8720853` or "DownOnSpot" with commits [signed by me](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0277672fc47209efc1b68455a9b3094acdb604b4) on GitHub),
but this is outside of my control and in the hands of GitHub.

Thanks for using DownOnSpot.
